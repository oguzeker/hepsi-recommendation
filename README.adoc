== * * *Please note that `Hepsi Recommendation` is currently deployed to the cloud in the form of a `Docker Swarm` cluster.*

You can list individual components of the cluster in the <<components, Components>> section.

== Summary

This is a demo project implemented for `*Hepsiburada*` interview rounds of *2020*. This is a just simple betting coupon sales application implemented only for demonstation purposes.

The application generates `ready-made` recommendations to the user, based on best-selling product categories and the interest of the user. Users can also query for and manage their browsing history of products in the system.

== Motivation

This application is implemented to unite batch and real-time data pipelines over a high-performance `Rest API`, all of which constitute a real-time recommendation engine.

== Code style

This project uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[`Model-View-Controller`] pattern for the directory structure and resposibility distribution among layers of abstraction.

We deliberately chose not to employ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-control-boundary[`Entity-Control-Boundary`] pattern for practicality.
